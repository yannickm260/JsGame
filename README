# JsGAME

This project is a simple JavaScript-based game where a character jumps to avoid an obstacle. The game features basic animations created using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. The user controls the character's jump by clicking a button, and the goal is to avoid colliding with the moving obstacle.

## Features

**Character Animation**: The character moves up and down to simulate jumping.
**Obstacle Animation**: The obstacle continuously moves from right to left across the screen.
**Collision Detection**: If the character collides with the obstacle, an alert is triggered, indicating that the player has lost the game.
**Tailwind CSS**: The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling and layout.

## Technologies Used

**HTML5**: Markup structure for the web page.
**CSS3**: Basic styling and animations using CSS keyframes.
**JavaScript**: Handling game logic, including jumping mechanics and collision detection.
**Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
